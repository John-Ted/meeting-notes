## :dart: Agenda

- ISR Safe track

## :closed_book: Discussions

You should never use those registers in the interrupt context.
Because save-restore

Kernels don't compile with floating point / vector registers.
In our case, we use the vector / floating point.

We need to make sure all functions that are called from ISR are not using those registers.

Code that is compiled as ISR safe is never 

Any solution is fine as long as we know at compile-time if the guarantee is broken.

MS: We could have two versions of the same function, but it's messy.

SK: We had the idea of `isrlib` of functions that don't use these registers.

SK: This is why a validation tool would be useful for this.

The compiler decides which instructions to use.

There are attributes to not use these registers.

One ideas is to use a separate section where to only use given functions (ISR safe).

AS: So in any case we need to traverse the call graph.

Other unikernels are not compiling like we do.
So they are not using extended registers.

SK: I assume there are some ways.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AS: Look into possible approaches of doing ISR-safe functions.
