### Agenda

* Current state of ukthread
* Review ukthread
* Next steps in Musl integration

### Discussions

DA: We talked about TLS support.

DA: I looked in Musl.
When doing system calls, we need to do the function calls instead of syscalls.

SK: The read syscall is redefined with macros.

SK: These wrappers should be part of our Musl port.

DA: Two approaches as in this document.

DA: Is there a call to `libc_start_main()`?

SK: The TLS part in `libc_start_main()` must be replaced.

SK: For init functions: constructors, thread init, the unikraft init table.

SK: See what the `libc_start_main()` and see how this can be tied to the init functions.

SK: Items such as TLS and dynamic information have to be cut down from Musl.

### TODOs and Decisions

DA: Ask Marc about the futex work.

SK: Complete `clone()` implementation by next meeting on Friday.

Meet next on Friday, April 1, 2022, 1pm CEST.
