### Agenda

* Updates on ukthread
* Reviews

### Discussions

SM: I took an initial look in the API.
It looks OK.

DA: My concern is that my changes are not going to fit into the new API.
These changes are going to be updated.

SK: What I hope is that we can select from top-to-bottom to remove parts.
I hope that the rework is a super easy implementation.

DA: I can work during the weekend by our next meeting.

SK: Musl is doing clone() at this point.
The way is to redirect that call to our clone() call.

DA: I use a clone() system call implemented by Daniel, registered with `_R`, not with `_LL`.

SK: I will do the `_LL` implementation.

DA: We should remove some things in Musl.
Some source code files are excluded from the build.

SK: We want to use as much as possible from Musl.
And only use the low-level parts (system call interface) with Unikraft.

SK: The only tricky part is the initialization of Musl and the TLS part.

RD: No action items for Sergiu at this point.
Sergiu can do reviews and provide feedback.

SK: I'm currently adding some code for clone().

### TODOs and Decisions

SK: Work on implementing clone().

SM: To keep a consulting role.

DA: To have a look with the syscall shim that SK mentioned.

DA: Check the uk_thread API and steps to integrate Musl.
