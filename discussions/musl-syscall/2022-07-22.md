## :closed_book: Discussions

DA: I didn't manage to make much progress, I was sick.

DA: However, I tested the new size of the TLS and it works.

SK: On RISC it's even worse because it's a different layout.

SK: I've changed our low-level TLS API.

SK: The layout of the TCB is completely arch dependent.
