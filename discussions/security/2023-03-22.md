## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

KD: We can provide an isolation that could be used for any type of OS data.

KD: I checked Hugo's paper and having something like MPK is a way to do it.

Another idea is the runtime protection used by Linux for internal data structure protection.

MP: Are we trying to protect the page tables once and for all?
Does the attacker have arbitrary write access and we want to see if it can do code execution.

HL: We want to prevent the attacker do do arbitrary code execution.
Even reading will break randomization.

HL: I think Unikraft has use cases for both of the cases of all time protection and using mmap.

HL: Maybe first we would have something that's usable and then move on to other items.

MP: We can have multiple solutions that we can choose from.

SS: I rebased the work done by Terry. I stumbled across some problems.
I've done some refactor of the code written by Terry.

SS: Right now we have stack and heap randomization.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

KD: Do a survey of the approaches that people are using for Linux and FreeBSD.

AA: Use `RDRAND` instruction in libsodium.

SS: Enable Terry's work for the latest version of Unikraft.

CB: Make CoverityScan work with Unikraft.
