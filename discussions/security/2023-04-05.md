- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Carol

I tried the method with Coverity using Travis CI.
I don't have resources to use it.

I'm now moving on using GitHub Actions.

I've solved the coverage part.

I did some prints in the Makefile and found out what libraries are linked to the final image.

HL: Most of the complexity is running the scanner on the code.

CB: The free tier is not available anymore, hence the use of GitHub actions.

CB: I will then look into integraging Klockwork and Polyspace.

### Alex

AA: I didn't get the time to look over libsodium.
