## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### ASLR

SS: Still busy debugging the boot problem.

SS: This is because of bugs induced by Marc's work.

HL: It sounds like a linker-script thing.

### Randomization

AA: I managed to use `libsodium` with the hw randomization API.
I made it work with x86.

AA: How should I test it?

### Static Analysis

CB: I created my own action on GitHub for using Coverity with Unikraft.

CB: You get a token and upload the data to Coverity.

CB: CodeQL builds a database.

CB: Submitted a request for ClockWork.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

SS: Start a thread with snippets and screenshot with the boot issue of poor man's ASLR.

MP: Review libsodium PR: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-libsodium/pull/8

AA: Run `lib-libsodium` for AArch64.

AA: Port `lib-openssl` on top of the hw rand API.

CB: Add a trigger when a pull request is created.

CB: Look how we can easily view (either on the PR screen) or as a link, the results of the checks.

CB: Completing CodeQL.

CB: Integrate to other repositories.

CB: Provide summary of results for offline analysis.
