### Agenda

* kraft Updates
* kraftkit Updates

### Discussions

SJ: Something was missing from the docs.

AJ: I've gone through the PRs.
I want to see if there is any sort of formatting issue.

AJ: I haven't been able to work on kraftkit.
The repository is in a good shape.
I need some time to add some missing parts before creating actual tasks that can be done.

AJ: I'll commit what I have.

AJ: The CLI tool has a nice architecture.
It also has a nice feature of extensions.
These extensions take the form of shared libraries.

AJ: Reasons for rewrite:
* The cloud / VM tool suite is full of tools written in Go.
* Features to have builds performed both locally and remotely.
* Installing the tool will mean getting the executable.
It was a nightmare to make and maintain a kraft package.

FH: I'm not as optimistic about the steps required.

AJ: We can introduce testing as we develop.

FH: I think you either reach this equivalence quickly or it will cover dust.

AJ: I'll bring together a plan on featurea and roadmap.

### TODOs and Decisions

GM: Have a look a the source code for the gh CLI command.

AJ: Plan of features and roadmap.

AJ: Push current repository contents.

SJ: Browse through the code for kraftkit.

RD: Invite Gaulthier to the next call.
