## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: Cezar and myself have been tackling multiple issues.

AJ: I've build the OCI package manager.
It allows us to use pre-built Unikraft images.

AJ: `kraft build` and `kraft run` work.

AJ: There are outstanding items, such as networking support.

AJ: Networking is not part of the OCI specification.

AJ: The run configuration will be packed in OCI.

AJ: Two items on the TODO list:
- networking
- volumes

AJ: I need to test the networking code.
After I submit the OCI work.

For volumes, the first part is going to be initramfs.

Cezar had been introducing a couple of workloads.
Each commit will be checked now.

### KConfig

Lukas: I opened the KConfig PR.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Talk to the Kraftkit testing to provide issues when running.

AJ: I'll have a look on the KConfig work.

AJ: Aim to integrate the networking from Cezar's work.
