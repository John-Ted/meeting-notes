## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: We have testing integrated in kraftkit.

AJ: All the dependencies for kraftkit are now up-to-date.

AJ: There are some bug fixes.

AJ: I've done authentication in order to enable pulling of private repositories.

AJ: We want to integrate QEMU with GitHub Actions.

Lukas: I wasn't able to use OCI.

AJ: You have a Google Cloud account and you've set up an artifact registry, right?

Lukas: I've tried using CTR but it fails.

AJ: Requirements for kraftkit 1.0:

- networking support
- volume support
- improving documentation
- make plugin system fully working
- Firecracker support
- improvements templating

AJ: It could be that someone picks up the package part of kraftkit to use for other unikernels.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: To work on networking support.

AC: Do more tests.

AJ: Verify if the OCI support is indeed working.
