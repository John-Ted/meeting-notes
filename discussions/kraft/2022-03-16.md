### Agenda

* kraft Updates
* Planning Go kraft (kraftkit)

### Discussions

SJ: I created a PR on advanced kraft usage.

SJ: I worked on all the PRs.

SJ: Ignore new version PRs for the time being.

AJ: I set up an initial project structure with some notes on what should go where.

SJ: I looked into the CLI tool from GitHub.

AJ: We can take a lot of inspiration from the GitHub CLI tool.

AJ: I'll push this to a private repository (kraft-kit).
It will be a set of tools.
All names will end with `u`: `runu`, `pckgu`.

AJ: You can have a developer who only wants to work on Unikraft core code.
Inside this repository there will a specification that allows us to transpose the functionality from the Python implementation to the newer one.

AJ: The License for the GitHub CLI is pretty permissive, so we can pull out items from that.

AJ: We'll use the same contributing / reviewing flow for kraft as for unikraft.

### TODOs and Decisions

* AJ: Look into the advanced kraft usage PR.

* RD: Merge approved PRs for kraft.

* SJ: Look into the kraftkit private repository.
