## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: There was Easter break in Germany.
OCI is nearly in.

AJ: We can now read a remote registry.

Maintainers of the community and CI/CD will populate the registry.

Multiple bug fixes.

Another item is going to be to add Docker support.

Lukas: No update at this point.

AJ: Marc added support for an entry point in the `Makefile`.

AJ: There is a `.kraftignore` file.

AJ: We want to make `kraft.yaml` as simple as possible.

Lukas: The problem is that in `kraftkit` there is no main Makefile.

AJ: The `make -C` command is used for changing the directory to the Unikraft core repository.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Work on networking support.

RD: Ask people to start using `kraftkit`.

AJ: To ping Marc about the entry point status in the build system.

Aim to have `kraftkit` in the Porto hackathon, May 10-11, 2023.

Lukas: Try out the OCI part.
