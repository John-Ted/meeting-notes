### Agenda

* kraftkit Updates

### Discussions

AA: We redid the cluster we used for runu.
We now have the cluster on its feet, just that it doesn't work.

AA: I will aim to help Costin with some libvirt components.

AA: For the cloning use cases, I was considering to make it more seamless.

AA: The deadline is in June.

GM: I managed to look into Alex's code.
Then I will work on the integrating manifest files.

GM: I know Alex made the `pull` command for kraftkit work.
I want to see if it works and then use that for the manifest work.
This is because for the manifest work we need versioning information.

GM: This is would be similar to a depend-bot, similar to crates in Rust.
This would be the final goal of the manifest.

SJ: Currently it replaces the archive with the executable.
I need to get the download and decompress part and integrate it my implementation.

### TODOs and Decisions

AA: Help Costin with the cloning use case.

AA: Make the cluster work.

GM: Work on manifest part, based on current information and the `pull` command.

SJ: Ask Alex if the release will be provided as a simple executable or an archive.
