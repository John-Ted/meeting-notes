# KraftKit meeting, 27 July 2022

## :dart: Agenda

- Testing
- Updates

## :closed_book: Discussions

SJ: What happened to the authentication token.

AJ: Ideally, no people would use a token.
Only CI/CD will pull data from repositories.

AJ: Inside `config.go` we would have these data stored.
There will be a public HTTP URL provided by kraftkit.
Users won't use a token.
We will have an HTTP server that provides this.

AJ: I expect to complete `ukbuild` this week.

AJ: This state is that `ukbuild` is missing. From then on, it will be easier to add stuff.
It works by having a process manager.
It has a configuration option to use a container.
And then, when `ukrun` taske place there will be plenty of room for implementation.

GM: I started looking on the group issue on the repository: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/issues/36

AJ: The way to approach this is to use Cobra configuration file.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Populate with GitHub issues.

AJ: Document commands to use in the future.

RD: Talk to Costi about joining the dev group.
