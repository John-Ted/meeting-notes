## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: We would get rid of libgit.

AJ: I'm juggling a couple of things.
I found some bugs.

AJ: A merge commit is created for each PR to add reviewed-by, approved-by and other GitHub and authorship information.

AJ: There is a bug that affects how we do builds in the CI/CD.

AJ: Kraftkit is being used in the CI/CD of Unikraft.io.

RD: Apart from the networking and libgit2 is there anything major missing.

CC: The only way to get the information is to constantly measure the size of the `.git` directory.

AJ: We can have this hacky solution at this point.

CC: We should also include the workflow PR.

CC: I will ask Ștefan for another review round.

AJ: We want to do a GitHub workflow that builds `kraftkit`.

CC: That's already there.

SJ: No updates from my side.

AJ: I want for people not to have to install all dependencies.
It would all be a Docker-based environment.

AJ: The runu part is something I couldn't touch due to NEC taint.

AJ: I've been in contact with containerd folks.

AJ: I'm using a newer containerd API.

AJ: Better volume support is a nice to have feature.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Create a kraftkit task force.

RD: Discuss with Andrei Albișoru.
