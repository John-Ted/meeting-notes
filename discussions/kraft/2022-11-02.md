## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

CC: I work on the kraft templating feature.
It is similar to `from` in Docker.
It will pick up the application version.

CC: Up until now there wasn't support for loading multiple `kraft.yaml` files.

CC: It took a bit to understand the objective from Alex.

CC: There is some OOP magic with reflection that is very specific / fragile.
There are some string mis-management issues.

Manifest file: https://manifests.kraftkit.sh/

CR: Still working on issue #35 and #36.

AA: Testing kraftkit

GM: I completed a PR for issue #102.
I assigned Alex to it.
It's related to error handling.

GM: I will next look on the issue with a library that we don't have.
It will then skip all the other libraries.

SJ: I fixed 2PRs.
They are on Alex to review.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

CC: Continue working on the kraft templating feature.

CR: Continue working on issue #36, the first one.

AA: Make kraftkit work locally.

AJ: Tasks for Andrei at the next meeting.

GM: Work on issue with missing library blocking all libraries.

SJ: Focus on the release.
