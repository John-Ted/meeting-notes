### Agenda

* kraftkit Updates

### Discussions

AJ: I added plugin functionality.
The system would have abstract interfaces that we could inject functionality to.

AJ: I talked to Simon on a new naming scheme, tools starting with `uk`: `ukrun`, `ukpkg` etc.

AJ: All plugins are available to all components in the kraftkit bundle.

AJ: Functionality can already be put together regarding manifest files.

AJ: The manifest Golang package should be able to get a path, read the file, error if the file is corrupt (outside the specification) and populate the contents.

SJ: I looked at the examples that Alex sent out.
They have the same convertion idea.
Their YAML file is quite similar.

AJ: What we require for parallel work, we require a common structure.
This structure will be common to all component, such as the A, L, P in the Makefile-based build system from Unikraft.
This will be a structure in Go code that we can then pass around.

AJ: We call these components in kraft.
Application, Library is a component.

AJ: I won't necessarily push the plugin.

### TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Work on improving kraftkit.

SJ/GM: Replicate the demo on using `ukpkg`.

GM: Work on the manifest part of the kraftkit.

SJ: Continue working on the YAML validator.
Aim to get this done in two week time, by May 4, 2022.
