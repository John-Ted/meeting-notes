## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: `ukbuild` is now available.
Most build options are available: `configure`, `fetch`, `prepare`, `build`, `update`.
At least it builds, it has some issues (as Cezar mentioned), but it works.
The issues are mostly tasks.

CC: For apps, the path in the YAML file is expected to be in the root of the app folder.

AJ: Everyone can self assign tasks as they pick them up.

Next meeting on Wednesday, August 17, 2022, 1pm CEST.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

Everyone: Create issues to keep track of things: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/issues

SJ/GM: Test `ukbuild` and jump into tasks.

RD: Talk to Costi about kraftkit involvement.

AA: Do cleanup work on runu.
