### Agenda

kraft Next Steps

### Discussions

First order of business is to make kraft work properly. Fix issues.

The tool should help people use Unikraft more than kraft.

kraft should be able to pull that functionality similar to container.

Deploying, running locally should be embedded into kraft.
We can do this quite well with Go.
runu should be part of the same toolkit.

We will end up with a single executable, making it much easier to deploy.

Having a separate repository for this makes more sense.

It makes sense to have different tools / binaries and you would only use those you are concerned about.
So we will have a toolkit, instead of a tool.

There is the discussion on kraft.yaml syntax for volumes.
We had this discussion with Simon in late 2021.

There is a diagram on the documentation side that shows the build process.
