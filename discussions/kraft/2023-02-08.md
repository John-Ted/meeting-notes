AJ: This has preventing a release.

AJ: I was able to do static linking with libgit2.

AJ: I submitted a fix for bubbletea.

CC: My PRs need to submitted.

CC: The next thing would be networking but that would require Alex working on it.

SJ: No updates.

AJ: There is a project that I assembled for command line interfacing to detect host information.

AJ: There is a piece of code that we can use: https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/blob/staging/machine/driver/detect_host.go

Alex, please arrange the next meetings.
We'll look into rescheduling the calls 

### TODOs and Decisions

RD: Assemble task force.

Wait for 0.4 release before assigning people to kraftkit testing.

AJ: Bring up networking.

SJ: Look around for libraries that help determine the distribution.
Work on a design document first.
Do it on HackMD.io.

GM: Take a look into open PRs for `kraftkit` so you can test them.

RD: Retry building kraftkit with the static `libgit`.
