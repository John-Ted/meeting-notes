## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: I'm still tackling networking.
It requires me to do a refactoring of the machine interface.

AJ: You must implement an interface for a new VMM.

AJ: As long as you implement this interface (currently CRUD).

AJ: As long as you implement the same interface, they would be interoperable.

AJ: There is an epic on testing.

Lucas: I changed the machine and now it works.

AJ: I wasn't able to replicate Lucas's issue.

Lucas: Would there be a `kraft push` command?

AJ: Yes, it's sure we will use it.

Lucas: Otherwise, it would be confusing for people to use Docker.

CC: I've been reviewing PRs.
There are still problems with `libgit2` that needs fixing.

AJ: Ideally we would be able to get rid of all dependencies.

AC: If you did the same thing locally, do you run into the same issue?

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Continue hacking / refactor network.

Lucas: Waiting for networking support.

AC: Use `kraftkit` for integration.

CC: Work on PRs.
Create a blog post with `packer`, that will be the announcement.
