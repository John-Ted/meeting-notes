## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: We've been doing great progress this week.
We've been pushing work in the past weeks: fixing and upstreaming code.

AJ: We aim to do a minor release that will incorporate most features 0.4.
We plan to have a 0.5 release late next week.

AJ: The `kraft run` command is now upstream.
There are some fixes for the UI.

AJ: We'll have networking support in Unikraft 0.5 + OCI support.

CC: What Alex said, I'm now looking at solving other PRs.

CC: There are still 16-17 PRs open.

Lukas: I'm working on the Kconfig parser and implementing a preprocessor.

AJ: The Unikraft Kconfig system has features that can't be handled by the default Kconfig parser in Go.
Not all `if`s are closed.
Also, some variables are used in Kconfig.
The results of the shell script has to be fed to the parser.

Lukas: I'm planning to do a draft PR.

SJ: I kept on the ELF loader integration.
The last few days and the next week will be busy for me.

RN: I've started to try to run `kraftkit`.
I used the `Kraftfile` for the `app-helloworld` application.

RN: It didn't work with `kraft.yaml` with other applications such as `app-nginx`.

AJ: New applications should use `Kraftfile` instead of `kraft.yaml`.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AJ: Release 0.5 with networking.
