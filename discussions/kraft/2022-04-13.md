### Agenda

* kraftkit Updates

### Discussions

SJ: I did a basic validator in Go.
I'm stuck in parsing the YAML targets.
The parser sees this as a single object.

AJ: You should be using (https://github.com/xeipuuv/gojsonschema, https://gopkg.in/yaml.v3).
The second one is something I used.

SJ: I just used the first one, not the second one.

AJ: I can give an example that does exactly this.
* https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/blob/master/interpolation/interpolation.go
* https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/blob/master/schema/schema.go
AJ: Look around the contents of the repo, it's fine to use a similar structure for schema/, interpolation/, etc.

AA: Currenly I made progress on Xen.
The networking is not breaking anymore.
I did some breakpoints to debug containerd and see where the pipelines break.

AA: There is a stat error and it's failing.

AJ: I appologize, I haven't been able to look into kraftkit.
I need to use the pkgu command to use an OCI format.
We want to use a fork of kraft, but it's cumbersome to use.

AJ: Likely, I will put up an initial version of pkgu.
Based on that, we can have items to work on.

AJ: We would be able to work on manifests.

AJ: Did you look in the index repository? https://github.com/unikraft/index

AJ: This a draft.
Happy to change this as things progress.
Maybe we could change distributions to channels.

AJ: I will push some code using this.
And we could use the pkgu tool.

### TODOs and Decisions

SJ: Continue work on the JSON schema validator.
See examples from AJ.

AA: Debug pipelines breaking.

AJ: Push draft version of pkgu to unlock work items.

GM: Check the index repository: https://github.com/unikraft/index
