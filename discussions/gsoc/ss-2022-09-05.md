## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS: I've completed content and reviews for USoC22.

MS: I'm stuck at a problem for context switch.
It happens when `pthread_join` is called.

MS: It should be solvable.
The `x18` register is filled with the new thread pointer.
But somehow it doesn't work.

RD: Try using GDB.
It should point you to the value that you store in `x18` and give you an insight on what's wrong.

RD: Also provide Vlad and myself with the source code of your test so we can replicate and investigate.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MS: Complete GSoC report.

MS: Work on fixing shadow stack context switch issue.

RD/VB: Investigate issue with Shadow Stack context switch.
