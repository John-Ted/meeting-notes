### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

MS: I tried using inline assembly as a constructor in a native Linux build.
I get a segfault.

RD: I may not be possible to do that without `arch_prctl` as that register could only be writable in kernel mode.

MS: There is little documentation on properly initializing shadow stack.
There needs to be some intervention from the developer.

RD: See the question from Xiangy on the #memory channel.

MS: I don't know yet how to build an AARCH64 program using clang (cross-compile).

### TODOs and Decisions

RD: Merge meeting notes PR from last meeting.

RD: Make updates to USoC requirements to also include QEMU: https://usoc21.unikraft.org/docs/sessions/01-baby-steps/

RD: Check Maria's code: https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work

MS: Add support in `ukboot` to initialize the shadow memory.

MS: Ask on the ARM channel about cross-compiling using clang.
