### Agenda

Technical kick-off
Planned next steps

### Discussions

MS: Current Shadow Stack support is only available with LLVM / Clang on aarch64.

MS: I went through first 2 sessions of USoC'21.
I didn't go into server builds as that wasn't interesting for my project.

MS: I still have to enhance my virtualization knowledge.

RD: Create simple programs in Linux and build them with clang and Shadow Stack support.

VB: I suggest you create a very simple helloworld program with Unikraft and build it with Clang and with Shadow Stack support.
See what errors / missing symbols you get and work around those.

VB: To compile with clang use:

```
make COMPILER=clang
```

Related work:
* KASAN: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/191
* uksp: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/uksp

Implementation examples:
* https://github.com/HexHive/ShadowStack

RD: See the Unikraft Google Drive folder, the `Unikraft - Resources` document, remote access systems

RD: Overall goal is to enhance security features of Unikraft: https://unikraft.org/docs/features/security/#security-features-and-testing-matching-linux

VB: Shadow stack support is added in GCC 12: https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=ce09ab17ddd21f73ff2caf6eec3b0ee9b0e1a11e

VB: Implementation should not be that difficult.

RD: If things move fast, then you'll spend time testing and adhering to good code quality conventions and aiming to get the code upstream.

### TODOs and Decisions

MS (1-2 weeks time):
1. Build applications on ARM
1. Access remote systems (Unikraft - Resources)
1. Build application with clag (make COMPILER=clang)
1. Build application with clang and shadow stack

MS: Use the `#security` channel for any sort of questions.

We meet next on Monday, June 20, 2022, 3:30pm CEST.
