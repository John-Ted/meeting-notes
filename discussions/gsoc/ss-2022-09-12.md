## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RD: I integrated all meeting summaries and the GSoC blog posts.

MS: I completed my evaluation for GSoC.
You will be asked for your evaluation sometime tonight.

MS: Everything is part of my repository.

MS: I didn't make progress on the technical side, i.e. fixing the `x18` related issue for scheduling.

MS The current setup uses clang.

MS: I need a vacation.
I will be away for about one week.

MS: Items on my TODO list:
- Solving newlib-related issue.
- Other issues with libraries.
- I talked to Ștefan about documentation updates for applications.
  The clang part will not be part of an application repository;
  it will be in the `docs` repository.
- Propose a design that integrates other security mechanisms such as CET.

RD: I will consider tracks for you to work on after this, based on the current OSS roadmap.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD/VB: Fill GSoC evaluation for Maria.

RD/VB: Check the setup for reproducing the scheduling bug with shadow stack.

MS: Ping Razvan about scheduling a call with Simon on newlib issue.

RD: Think of track suited for Maria after the full completion of her GSoC work.
