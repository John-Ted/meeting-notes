## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MS: I created a draft PR.
I will do this on Wednesday or on Thursday.

MS: I allocated the shadow stack with the same size of the software stack on Unikraft.

MS: I fixed the trap issue with the `-ffixed-x18` for Unikraft.

MS: I plan to test for Redis, SQLite and Nginx.

MS: There are inconsistencies and errors in USoC documentation.

RD: There are likely issues when using SQLite, Redis and others due to the mount tag used by `qemu-system-x86_64` and generated by `make menuconfig`.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Create forks of all applications in [`cs-pub-ro` organization](https://github.com/cs-pub-ro/).

MS: Create draft PR.

RD/VB: Take a look into on [Maria's Unikraft fork](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/unikraft-scs/unikraft-scs-wip.md).

MS: Create matrix of build / run progress for applications: Redis, Nginx, SQLite for gcc-x86, gcc-arm, clang-x86, clang

MS: Investigate CET.

MS: Create blog post.

RD: Investigate Redis run without kraft.

RD/VB: Read [document](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/utils/doc-scs-arm-vs-x86.md) on issue with shadow stack on x86.
