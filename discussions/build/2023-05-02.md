## :closed_book: Discussions

### Long Arguments

MS: Make passed the full command to the SHELL.

RK: There are two limits:
- The size limit for the whole environment - including the arguments.
  It's quite big.
- There is a limit for each individual argument.
  This is the limit we run into, because we squash the command into one argument.
  If you put everything into one argument, there is a much smaller size limit.
- The command of the shell is passed by Make as one argument to the shell.

```
sh -c "gcc bla.c -o bla.o"
```

- This doesn't happen in any of the two solutions: entire command in one file, arguments in one file.

MS: It would be better to use `@args`.
It's useful for `make V=1`, and it's cleaner.

RK: It was the solution I initially presented.
Simon requested adding the entire command in a command file.
Simon mentioned this should be easier for debugging.
And other tools may not understand the `@args` syntax, to be able to read the arguments from the command line.

MS: One of the problem is `fixdep`.
`fixdep` looks at the command line and outputs a snippet of a Makefile.
It has to read the command.

RK: If the content of the file changes, `fixdep` wouldn't work, because it doesn't look inside the file.

RK: If we would pass the checksum of the `.cmd` file (or the modification date), it might fix `fixdep`.

MS: The problem is that the command file is only read, and changes are not visibile.

RK: `makedep` only looks if the file changed; and, if you only pass the command filename, that doesn't happen.

MS: My issue is that some tools parse the Make output and Make doesn't provide any output.

MS: Even if tools require the arguments (to parse), they are likelier to support the `@args` syntax and work with that.
The use of an entire `.cmd` file is probably not as supported as `@args`.

MS: It's still a fairly low-priority stuff.

MS: It's a bit annoying to have to do `make clean` before a `make` command.
But we can still live with that.

### AArch64 Cross-compiler (emuTLS)

RK: The ideal solution is to have a compiler that could disable emuTLS.

MS: Krafkit allows to build custom toolchains.
That would solve the issue of using a custom GCC build.

AJ: Yes, this ensures that Unikraft will build.

MS: IIRC, GCC provides the way it's configured.
Nothing stops us from taking the Aarch64 cross-compiler configuration and adapt it to our GCC build.

MS: Is it as simple as taking Aarch64 configuration and look into that?

AJ: It's a one liner that you could use.
The default ENTRYPOINT is `kraftkit`.
You could update it to Bash and then you could interact with the build / run tools.

RK: If Clang works, we might just use that.

RK: The Docker-based solution might be hard to integrate into environments that are part of a bigger build.

AJ: You can use `krafkit` outside of the container, together with the other tools.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

SK: Argue on using the `.cmd` files instead of the `@args` approach.

SK: Present requirements / issues with `fixdep` in the current setup.

TODO: Assign people in the community to use the custom GCC / QEMU Docker-based setup that's provided with `kraftkit`.

TODO: [someone] Look into solving the emuTLS AArch64 issue with the custom GCC from `kraftkit`.
