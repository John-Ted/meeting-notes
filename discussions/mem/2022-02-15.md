### Agenda

* ASLR Unikraft support

### Discussions

RD: I am interested in aligning ASRL support with future paging support (+TLS, +ELF loader).

TL: I created a shuffle of the areas inside the executable via the linker script.

TL: I tested it and it works.

TL: I cannot change the 0x10000 start address as that's used by KVM booting.

GG: This solution is simpler and uses less memory than the PIE-support implemented by Daniel (with a split kernel + initrd image).

GG/TL: The aim is to integrate the solution with memory deduplication.
It will require the update of the offsets in the GOT/PLT sections in different executables but without modifying the text memory areas, that can then be reused in multiple running images (deduplicated).

GG/TL: This could be released as open source at the end of April 2022.

GG: I'll resume taking part in the community meetings and provide updates.

### TODOs and Decisions

RD: Think about future steps involving ASLR + paging support.

TL: At some point release this as an open source PR.

TL: Consider shuffling library text sections in the linker script.

TL/GG: Work on integrating memory area shuffling with deduplication.
