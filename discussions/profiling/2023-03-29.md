### VMI

AV: I need to look into Unikraft offsets for VMI.
The first thing initialized is paging and memory addressing.

I want to make a sequence of steps

Just take some of the fields and then hardcode items.

It's enough to just know which offsets in the standard fields are.

MR: In our case we can just hard code the offsets.

AV: I'm fairly familiar with the VMI API.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AV: Initialize paging and see if we can do the initial VMI support.
And look into the thread structure.

AV: Hardcode values, do not have addresses found at runtime.
