## :closed_book: Discussions

### VMI

AV: I first tried to create the Nginx server.

AV: This is for `libvirt` interface.

AV: libvmi uses libvirt to pause and interact with the VM.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AV: Provide details / draft PR with `libvirt` interation with Unikraft.

AV: Work on integrating `libvirt` and `libvmi` for basic Unikraft use case.
