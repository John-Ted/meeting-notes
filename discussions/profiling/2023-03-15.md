## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### VMI

AV: got it to work on the host apart from the VM

MR: Did you check how hard it would be to integrate Unikraft support locally there?

AV: Not sure, but I will try

MR: This should be the first step to try

MR: What else do you need offsets for, the task struct and what else?

AV: I'll send it to the chat

MR: Can you list all virtual memory areas in VMI?

AV: Should be doable

MR: First step you should see how complicated this is to do and which parts are the most minimal to try out

MR: You could try the thread structure first

MR: It's probable that the struct will need translation which means it will need paging support

AV: Ok thanks, next time I'll probably have a better idea and come with new questions

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AV: Start working on the VMI for Unikraft.

GM: Provide 2-3 months roadmap for probing work.

AP: Provide 2-3 months roadmap for GCOV work.
