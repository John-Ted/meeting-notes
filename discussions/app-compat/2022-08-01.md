## :dart: Agenda

- Status updates
- Next steps
- Release plans

## :closed_book: Discussions

DA: I integrated Simon's changes.

DA: When I will integrated Simon's destructor on the self unmapping, we will have everything on the pthread API.

SK: Some changes broke something in the binary compatibility layer.
Now we need to differentiate between a binary compatibility.

SK: After this, then fix `exit()` then rebase.

DA: If you're not calling the futex destructor, the thread calling `pthread_join()` will wait for ever.

SK: We may need to patch `pthread_exit()` as well.
Then I was thinking whether we can free the structure.

SK: If `clone` were to be bypassed, some subsystems would be passed.
And `pthread_exit()` would have to be patched.

SK: I was thinking whether this is a too much API update.

DA: It's not.

RD: Let's meet daily.
I will ask Florin to join, to be ready to port the tests on the future rebased version.

RK: Could I have access to that?

DA: I think it's public.

RD: I will ask Florin to provide you a link.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

DA: Test the ukthread API.

DA: Integrate destructor fix from Simon.

SK: Fix breaking of dual-TLS for binary compatibility mode.

SK: Solve issue with exit destructor.

SK: Rebase to `staging`.

RK: Run tests on Musl.
