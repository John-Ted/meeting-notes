## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

SK: You could cache those values for some functions.

SK: The high-level design is what I would expect.

You shouldn't do string comparisons in procfs, you should do them in vfscore.

It would be good to use `container_of`.

SK: I suspect you could avoid totally the use of string compare.

You would get the notification callbacks.

AM: Think about caching / entry / lookup for static entries.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AM: Update implementation to the most recent version of Unikraft.
