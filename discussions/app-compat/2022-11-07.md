## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Release planning

## :closed_book: Discussions

RD: I solved the Musl build warnings.
These items would probably require upstreaming in Musl.

SK: Ideally we would not modify Musl.
We can move some definitions to `nolibc` to compatibilize it + LWIP with Musl.

SK: The same goes for `nolibc` errors.

FP: I grouped tests.
For the nolibc test, I have issues with `M_PI` and others.

RD: The default option should be `n` (`no`).

SK: Tests should be simplified as much as possible for `nolibc` to work.

FP: There are two tests failing.

SK: The `...wait()` function doesn't work.

RK: No update from my side, I will do testing on ARM with the new versions of scripts.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

DA: Review Simon's PRs.

DA, AS: Integrate comments from Robert.

RD: Update Musl PRs for removing build issues according to feedback from Simon

RD: Integrate `uksignal` with Musl.

RD: Add scripts for other applications.

FP: Ignore `nolibc` for tests that fail on `nolibc`.

FP: Complete `libc-test` grouping.

FP: Use default `n` for test groups.

SK: Rewrite history for own PRs.

SK: Rreview Dragoș's PR on Musl / threading.
