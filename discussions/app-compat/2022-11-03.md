## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

RK: Tests for Musl, there is x86 specific testing.

SK: Guard tests could be used to separate tests among different architecture.

SK: But the best solution is to use a generic API.

FP: How can I make threading work with `nolibc`, since there is no pthread interface.

FP: For the `do-libc-test` you have to wait a while because there are so many tests.

SK: It is a good idea to print the values of tests.
Now you don't see anything, you can assume there is something wrong.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

DA: Update tests to use generic non-architecture specific APIs - if possible.

RK: Update tests for aarch64.

FP: Add glue code test for `access` as reported by Maria.

FP: Look into printing values for tests.

SK: Find time to rewrite the commit history for the Unikraft PRs.

RD: Integrate the PRs that have been left out.

RK: Run the `do-libc-test` on aarch64.
