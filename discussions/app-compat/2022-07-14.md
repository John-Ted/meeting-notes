## :dart: Agenda

- `clone()` update
- testing Musl

## Notes 

AS: The posix-futex PR (https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/488) is up, I'm waiting for reviews.

DA: I did't get to talk to Simon about issues with `clone()` flags.

SK: I recall implementing `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`, maybe not `CLONE_DETACHED`.

DA: I'm running a simple application that does `pthread_create()`.
I hardcoded the `TCB_RESERVE` to `280`.

DA: The child return value doesn't return 0 for `clone()`.

SK: I would also look into replacing syscall with the direct call to `uk_syscall_r_exit()`.

SK: I can only work on this starting from Monday.

DA: Create a setup with the current implementation (Unikraft, Musl, application) that tests the threading work in Musl.

FP: Create a setup with the current tests.

SK: I approve the idea to use a patch in Musl to disable VDSO.

## :closed_book: TODOs and Decisions

SK: Fix `clone()` flags.

DA: Provide list of missing flags for Simon to implement.

SK: Move this on top 0.9 Unikraft.

RD: Talk to Aadhi.

DA: Provide a setup that we can replicate with the current thread / clone work in Musl.

FP: Provide a setup that we can replicate with the current tests in Musl

AS: Be on the lookout for posix-futex reviews.

We meet next on Monday, July 18, 2022, 1pm CEST.
