### Agenda

* Current state of ukthread / clone
* Musl integration
* synchronization / futexes

### Discussions

DA: I'm looking into how I can work with the TLS.
I have to look more into this.

SK: It's probably `thread_init`.

DA: Simon has new changes to the clone() syscall.

SK: There is a clone flag that Musl uses to inform the kernel something related to semaphores.
Adina needs to look into that.
The set/get_robust_list syscalls are tied to this.

SK: I'm working on the `wait()` syscall.

FP: I've cloned the private repository that Dragoș told me to copy.
I did some tests.

FP: I don't have many questions.
I first wanted to make sure that everything works well together.

FP: I downloaded the tests.
A segfault appear.
I will look at that.

SK: Please post it on the `lib-musl` channel.

DA: I can point Florin to the tests that work and those that don't work.

DA: Do tests and then start testing actual applications.

SK: Slowly upstream changes to Musl.

### TODOs and Decisions

SK: Work on clone() and wait() syscalls.

DA: Work on TLS integration with Musl.

RD: Create a mindmap of tasks related to musl / binary compat call.

RD: Think of assisting Dragoș on Musl task.

FP: Ask questions on lib-musl channel.

FP: Aim to run and enrich tests for Musl.
