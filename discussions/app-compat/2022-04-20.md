### Agenda

* Binary compatibility
* synchronization work

### Discussions

RD: These are the instructions for the binary compat work at the hackathon: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CwiWzKhtCXu8GbooWNcI3cw2-8yrGPPA

RD: We used a non-lwip version of the ELF loader because there are issues when using lwip.

RD: Changes were required in lwip because the `uk_sched_get_default()` function has been replaced by `uk_sched_current()`.

RD: Apart from the lwip issues, there is an issue with the `arch_prctl()` syscall on glibc 2.31.
This is an issue related to the use of Intel CET.
There is a `helloworld-glibc2.31` PIE executable with this issue: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CwiWzKhtCXu8GbooWNcI3cw2-8yrGPPA

RD: Use strace to see that.

FH/SK: Use the set of pre-compiled binaries: https://github.com/mosajjal/binary-tools

GM: We used these binaries.
However, some of them aren't built with `-static-pie`.

RD: I will test the binaries.
I will test snippets of code we use for our OS class.

AS: I'm working on testing the `uk_print` SMP-safe implementation.

### TODOs and Decisions

SK: Debug lwip issue with binary compatibility.

SK: Look into `arch_prctl` issue with binary compatibility for executables linked against glibc 2.31.

AS: Continue work on testing SMP support in printing library.

RD: Build and test executables using the ELF loader: OS class demos, https://github.com/mosajjal/binary-tools, real-world applications
