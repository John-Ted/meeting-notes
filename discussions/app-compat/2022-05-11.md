### Agenda

* Bootstrap Florin in the project

### Discussions

DA: The syscall shim replaces the the syscall handler with a direct call to the system call implementation.

DA: Currently, we won't have the `syscall` instruction, we will do a direct call to the Unikraft syscall function.

DA: We replaced the `syscall_cpX` macros in the Musl syscall implementation.

RD: Florin, steps do do:
* build Unikraft + Musl support
* exercise Musl interface

### TODOs and Decisions

Florin: Make Musl work on the setup from Dragoș.
