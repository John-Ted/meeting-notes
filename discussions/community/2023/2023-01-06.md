and ideally, for some development work

Re-design community meetings to make them more participative: demos, questions
  - Make it office hours
  - Show & tell (as demo)
  - Distinct meeting times
  - Bi-weekly meeting for office hours (30 minutes)

Organize monthly hackathons (one Saturday per month)

Improve hackathon contents
  - making content work from the start
  - improve the hackathon tasks
  - think of prizes / awards

Start organizing USoC'23

Organize GSoC'23

Document internal libraries

### Higher-level Goals

Constant progress in adding new libraries and applications in the Unikraft ecosystem: native and binary compatibile

New release plan: a release every 3 months, 2 week feature freeze window before hand

Improvements / updates to governance / CI/CD to automate integration, static checking, integration testing, workflows

Integration testing, new branch model (`stable`, `staging`), `uktest` for all internal libraries

Handling of upstream application / libraries version

Increase platform support (Firecracker, Hyper-V, VMware, GCP, CloudVM)

Recruiting track owners, people to ensure technical progress on different areas of the Unikraft ecosystem

### Community Guidelines

Make sure people know what you are working on.
Be verbose about your work.
Others may be doing the same and duplicate the effort.
Create early draft PRs.

Take the initiative: come up with proposals, voice concerns, provide your input, be critical, be assertive, take charge, ask for ownership.

Ask for help: no one knows everything.
Don't be afraid / ashamed / reluctat to ask, even stupid questions.

Provide support: when someone asks for help, if you have the time and knowledge, help them.

You have a great responsibility as a reviewer.
Take good care of items you are a reviewer of.
Be rigurous: test everything, make sure you understand, make sure the solution is sound, make sure the design is sound.
Be considerate: provide constructive feedback, accept that someone may be a beginner and still making the first steps on contributing.
Perfection is achieved through iteration.
It's OK and expected to do do multiple review rounds.

As a reviewer, have a review day per week.

As a contributor, your contributions are valued and appreciated.
Be aware that getting someting in may take a while.
Make that easy by following the contributors guidelines, providing good quality commits and sound design.
Be aware that a good reviewer will ask for even minor updates; it's expected, we value code quality.
Create early draft PRs.
