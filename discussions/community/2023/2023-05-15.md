## :dart: Agenda

- Post-release items: feedback, suggestions, lessons learned
- Near term goals: app compatibility, usability (kraftkit), documentation
- Steps towards release 1.0 (late January 2024)
- Current tracks in the community
- Recent and future events: hackathons, meetings

## Discussions

### Post-release

- Release 0.13 to happen today, Monday, May 15, 2023, 2 weeks after the planned release deadline of May 1, 2023.
- RD: We'll keep the freeze window for future releases, though realistically it won't work out as planned.
Still it's good for an early deadline.
- Community needs to mature to be able to have more reviews and testing done in time, not to close to the release deadline.

### Near Term Goals

For release 0.14 and the next months:

- App compatibility: improving, increasing # of apps
- Usability: kraftkit integration, scripts, testing
- Documentation
  - kraftkit
  - internal library READMEs
  - source code comments (Doxygen-style)
  - coding conventions: https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/248
- Coding convention integration
  - Team to update source code
- Plat re-arch
  - RISC-V
  - Hyper-V, VMware, Firecracker integration
- Features
  - Go support
  - ukfdtab
  - ukshutdown
  - uksignal
  - ukstore
- kraftkit improvements:
  - networking support
  - Kubernetes support
- versioning
  - versioning of upstream libraries coupled with Unikraft versions
- Rust support
  - running Rust applications
  - internal Rust libraries
  - Unikraft as a static library
- C++17
- `vfscore` cleanup

### Release 1.0 items

release 0.14 - late July 2023
release 0.15 - late October 2023
release 0.16 will be 1.0 - late January 2024 (before FOSDEM'24)

Roadmap: https://hackmd.io/@unikraft/HyNdSyAki

Apart from near term goals:

  - proper synchronization (all over the libraries)
  - `uktest` (all over the internal / external libraries)
    - improving / update `lib-libc-test` and test Musl, newlib, nolibc
  - security features (ShadowStack, CET, page protection, CCA / SEV, ASLR / PIE)
    - static checkers (part of the CI/CD)
  - CI/CD support (full open source)
  - procfs / sysfs support
  - netlink socket support
  - kernel log exporting (get debug message from the running unikernel instance)
  - ARM64 virtualization (R-Pi4) - Xen, KVM
  - improved Xen support (includ ARM64)
  - baremetal / driver support
  - kraftkit 1.0 release (?)
  - Unikraft loader, Unikraft packaging
  - SMP-aware scheduling
  - automatic API documentation generation (from the source code)
  - other platforms / hypervisors (Intel Cloud Hypervisors, Ampere)
  - block device support (?)
  - `vfscore` redesign
  - safety (obeying some level of certification / regulations - MISRA C)

### OSS Technical Tracks

- Application compatibility: binary compatibility + native support
  - Goals: increase the number of ported / working applications
- Language support
  - Goals: Provide support to develop applications that will then run on Unikraft without caring about Unikraft
  - Rust, Go JavaScript, Python, Lua, PHP, Ruby, C++
- Security
  - Goals: add security features, improve overall security, provide configuration to balance security and performance, have security advisory
- Plat re-architecting
  - Goals: provide better source code layout and overall design and separation of platforms and architectures
- Synchronization / SMP
  - Goals: provide multi core support, add scheduling, ensure performance, add scheduling support
- Kraftkit
  - Goals: ease of use, build, deploy; integration with 3rd party tools for cloud development / deployment
- Overall improvement of code quality
  - Testing, coding conventions, static checkers
  - Goals: code quality, consistency, obeying good practices
- Profiling / Benchmarking / Introspection
  - Goal: Gather runtime information and use to improve performance
  - kprobes, VMI, coverage
- Packaging and booting
  - Goal: get unikernel images able to easily boot in different configurations
  - Unikernel loader, PIE, block device support
- Baremetal / Drivers / Embedded
  - Make Unikraft work on embedded device, either baremetal or virtualized
  - ARM64 virtualization, driver shim layer, baremetal targets
- Documentation
  - Goal: Make it as easy as possible to use, deploy, develop and debug Unikraft
  - Gneerating APIs, Doxygen documentation, README files
- Build system
  - In conjunction with language support
