## Agenda

0.9 release (Hypersion)

## Discussions

RD: For the 0.9 release we will have SMP support, planned to be upstream early next week (June 6-10, 2022).
What items we have prepared then will be integrated into the release and the release will happen.

MR: For SMP, the ARM implementation and x86 have common parts.
I decided to put code in plat/common/.

MR: This is the PR that I created yesterday.
There are synchronization issues.
I have a local version on my machine.

MR: I will then continue testing everything on x86.

MR: RV, do you know how to make the ARM version working?

RV: I can do that tomorrow.

MR: On the x86 it is a bit more complicated, since we are using an older system.

MR: At least on native platforms it is not allowed to have APIC and older PICs enabled.

MR: I need to initialize the APIC that takes over the PIC functionality.

MR: I still have some architectural issues with SMP

SK: 0.10 release will be application support: musl, clone syscall, uksched, POSIX socket driver, mmap proper implementation, syscall integration
