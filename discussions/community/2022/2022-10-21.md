### Events

Romania community meeting (October 14-16, 2022): fun and productive.
We will organize one yearly.
Andrei Mutu is preparing a blog post.

Munich hackathon this weekend (October 22-23, 2022).
60 participats, with great involvement from the organizers.
Will be back with pictures and we will have a blog post.

We want to have a healthy frequence of blog posts.
Andrei Mutu is working on creating a list of technical posts.

We plan a hackathon with Karlruhe in January-March 2023, likely tied to another event.

FOSDEM'23 will take place in early February 2023.
We will lead a devroom: "Microkernels and Component-based OS".
We will advertise FOSDEM to have talks submitted.
Last year we had 3 talks at FOSDEM'22.
It was online, this year it will be live.

We plan a hackathon in Manchester next year.

Another one is scheduled in Israel, in June 2023.

We are also targeting Amsterdam and Athens as possible hackathon locations.

And we're thinking of a hackathon in the United States.

### Musl

SK: There are updates on Unikraft: 4 connected PRs that I submitted (with updates from Robert): https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pulls
Dragoș and Răzvan are reviewing them.

SK: There are Musl-related PRs: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl

Musl will become the standard libc for Unikraft.
newlib will be of low-priority.

I will reply to the issues encountered by the testing team.

Florin is working on libc tests (exported from Musl): https://github.com/unikraft/lib-libc-test

`pthread-embedded` will probably be dropped completely.

We don't have the CI/CD system at the level we want.

Low priority for `pthread-embedded`.
If it's simple: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-pthread-embedded/pulls

If someone is really dedicated, they could port `pthread-embedded` on top of the new scheduling API.

HL: How will this work?
Should it be deprecated?

SK: We'll keep it for compatibility with older versions of Unikraft.

HL: Update the README for `pthread-embedded` to make it clear it's not supported in future Unikraft versions.

### PR Preview

SK: The `posix-mmap` PR to be updated for ARM (Robert, Michalis could do it).

This PR (https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/602) is due to the use of `printf` when TLS is not initialized.

The proper fix is to add a basic `uk_print_...` function.

SK: Musl + binarycomp are the critical parts of release 0.11.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

all: Merge in `staging-muslpreview`.

TODO: Update README of `pthread-embedded` to state it clearly doesn't work.
