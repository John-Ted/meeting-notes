### Agenda

* Preparation for 0.7 release: PR walkthrough
* Other tasks for the release
* Documentation website
* Other topics

### Discussions

AJ: I introduced a step into the release CI/CD pipeline.

AJ: I started tagging libraries that have a Makefile.uk with a version, to tag the current version.

AJ: The purpose is to show the version of the library, instead of the Unikraft version.

AJ: For the kraft release it might make sense to have a version of the library written in the yaml specification.

AJ: There may be an issue with dependency logic.

AJ: The machine for CI/CD is a rather big machine. It's maybe too big. Concourse is breaking on places such as the number of processes in the system.

AJ: It may be better to have a cluster of machines at UPB.

RD: For kraft, dependabot is enabled and created PRs.

AJ: This is something we want to do for the Unikraft ecosystem.

PU: I'm trying the netdev for VMware. To see a support.

PV: I'm analyzing the code to register a driver, call virtualization function.

PV: My goal is to initialize something in Hyper-V.

### TODOs and Decisions

* AJ: Move the kraft.yaml version in each repo to the newer version.

* AJ: Leave the dependabot PRs for now.

* RD: Schedule VMM call.

* RD: Schedule call on PIE support.
