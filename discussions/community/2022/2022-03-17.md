CV: How should people apply to GSoC?
Better define this.

### AWS Page Testing

MR: We are preparing for the commercial side an Amazon VM.
We want to see if there.

#### Technical Tracks

##### ARM

RV: SMP comments replied from Michalis and Rene.
It was a discussion on using arrays for logical ID to physical ID mapping.
Discussion on the SMP support channel.

SK/MR/RV: At the moment, there is no need for another structure, given the compile-time building of CPUs.

RD: I will work on the PL031 driver.

RV: Updating the PSCI interface with the updates from Michalis on the SMCC implementation.

RD: Different system calls are provided

RV: What we are doing now is keeping the implementation 

SK: Musl will rely on it's own syscall interface.

RV: ukplat_lcpu_id

##### Paging API

MR: Michalis is implementing the ARM side.
He will be able to give general feedback.
He won't be able to review the page allocator.
It would be awesome to have uk_test added to the API.

##### ukthread

SK: There is now a clean version of the threading API.

SK: I'm working on the cloning.

SK: There will be fixes for the TLS.

##### VMM

PV: Hyper-V v2 don't a PIC.
We have to use the timers that Hyper-V offers.

##### kraft

AJ: We want to implement a new version of kraft (kraftkit) written in Go.
It features multiple tools, each with their own role.

AJ: Components are build, pckg, run

AJ: I created a repository with the new code base.

SK: Please do a review and do extra tests.
