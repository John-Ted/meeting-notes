### Release 0.10

CC: I did a review of the 4PRs.
The most important is the 2nd round of review, will be delivered by Simon.

RV: Two types of syscalls: deprecated (silenty remove, don't through any error) and arch-specific (add specific guards for each archictures - both on Makefile and source code).

MR: Priority is on Musl.
If possible, not postpone the release, as OpenSynergy requires this release to be on time (with Musl support).

AM: Mostly I reviewed the ukstore dynamic.
Waiting for Simon.
We are expected to get an erorr, not a warning.

CC: I see some errors too, besides warning.

CC: There was something some Simon wanted to do with the dynamic part (I don't quite remember what that was).

RV: I talked to Michalis about the GICv3 issues (SGIs aren't delivered properly). He said he spotted an issue, but needs to take a deeper look.
