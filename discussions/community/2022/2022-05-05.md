### Updates

RV: The current PR contains the boot code for the CPU on ARM.
I'm testing it and see if it works.
Then I will ask to do a PR on it.

CV: Discuss with Marc on x86 SMP PR review.

### PR walkthrough

SK: Before doing tests for network-related libraries we need to add basic functionality in uknetdev.

AJ: This is going to be a dependency loop.

SK: I would prefer having this enabled to have a target for tests.

SK: Maybe we can split the ukstore PR in two parts.
It may be realistic to integrate the static PR.

Maintainer discussion: PIE, packaging, booting: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/239

SK: Open the ukthread PR in two weeks time.

AJ: Wait for POSIX driver before creating the UNIX socket PR.

### Others
