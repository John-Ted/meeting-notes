#### Community Events

ASPLOS tutorial took place on Tuesday, March 1, 2022.
Only 3 participants, but good discussions.

We'll have concrete information this week on:
* a German hackathon
* a French hackathon
* an Asian hackathon

Xen Summit is approved to take place on September 20-22, 2022 (Tuesday-Thursday).
We want to have a Unikraft workshop in conjunction with Xen Summit 2022 in summer, at UPB.

Our application got accepted at GSoC'22.
We're now discussing with potential applicants and locating mentors.

We plan for USoC in late summer.

Blog post schedule: https://github.com/orgs/unikraft/projects/26

We aim for diploma / master project students to create a blog post at the end of their project.

#### Technical Tracks

SJ: Wait for kraft restructuring.

CV: No need to add new entries in the multiboot unified structure.

SM: To discuss with Hugo / Pierre about results of running Loupe.

CC: Michalis updated the pointer auth support PR.
I will review it.

CC: The BTI PR relates to the pointer auth PR.
RazvanV may require some inputs from me.

PV: I reproduced what Thun did.
It works with multibootv1 and blocks at the timer setup.
I created an ISO image.
It boots on Hyper-V gen2.

CV: I think we can use the HPET timer for now.

CV: It doesn't require looking into ACPI tables.

PV: I was thinking to use the timer from the Hyper-V interface.

PV: It's weird that Multibootv2 doesn't work.

CV: Did you use the same patches for Multibootv2?

CV: Aadhi did something to disable some modules.
And maybe you didn't disable those modules in Multibootv2 and that's why it doesn't work.

CV: Have you tried without the menuconfig, with the scripts that I have in the PR.
