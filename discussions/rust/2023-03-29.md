## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

VB: I'm slowly getting `tiny-http` to work.
There are a couple of functions that have multiple definitions.

VB: There are some linking issues with `ukrust` enabled.
This is not required, but I want to have both the internal libraries and outside components written in Rust.

VB: I'm building an ALIB and linking it with Unikraft.

MK: I bumped into a similar issues.
This is upstream in the Rusty Hermit.

MK: You don't want to use the same symbols.
The kernel shouldn't use the same kernel space operations.

MK: If you didn't use ukrust, what problems did you encounter?

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

VB: Post issues on the `rust` Discord channel.

VB: Progress on using the Unikraft-centric build.

RD: Ask about Rust in the build system meeting.
