## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: There is another step (`mkbootinfo`) that would needs to happen at a later step.

MK: Having Cargo and rustc do the linking, we would require a wrapper.

MK: We could ship a wrapper command.
Or ditch this effort.
We would ideally also need a way to invoke the after-link steps.

MK: The `unikraft-rs` approach would need to modify the linking step in the middle.

MK: If you use lwip and Musl, the build fails.

MK: For the Cargo-based, I want to use kraftkit.

MK: I could work on reducing the changes to standard Rust.

MS: It would be something like `x86_64_unikraft_musl_linux`.

MK: Mustang is building Rust application without libc.

MK: I see arguments for both Linux being as an OS and a vendor.

MK: One thing with specialized targets, we would have less to compile.

### Unikraft-centric Approach

VB: No updates at this point.

VB: Borrow target.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Bring the discussion on Rust to the build-system discussion.

RD: Look into Martin's instructions for using kraftkit.

MK: Work on reducing the changes to standard Rust.

VB: Work on Unikraft-centric approach.
