## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: From my point of view there should be no reference to Cargo in the Unikraft repository. (If cargo transparently builds unikraft)

RD: Yes, I think that how it is now.
Only part of the PR should be merged upstream.
The other part will be part of some external (out-of-tree) library / application.

MK: Which part?

MK: In RustyHermit, we use Cargo everywhere.
There are options to decide which features we want compiled in the kernel.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Folder / Tag for meeting notes.

RD: What is the point of PR #291: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/291

RD: Talk to Vlad about the current state and goals of the Rust track.

RD: Is there anything else required to be able to reimplement internal libraries in Rust?
