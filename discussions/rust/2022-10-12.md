## :dart: Agenda

- Current state of Rust work
- Next steps, resource requirements (including people)

## :closed_book: Discussions

VB: Work on Rust over Unikraft was on standby so far, we want to get it back on track

MK: We added rusty hermit as a target to rust (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/hermit).
Unikraft will probabily want to do the same.

DK: Last time I tried to use rust std with musl I had problems

DK: I encountered problems with Unikraft's BSD style sys calls

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

MK and DK will help with the reviews and solving issues

VB will look into backporting the new Linux patches into Unikraft

We will have to upstream MK patches soon.
Once MK's patches are upstreamed, he will try to use some cycles for future Rust work.
