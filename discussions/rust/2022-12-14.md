## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: I want to try to use the `unikraft` crate for most (all?) use cases for `unikraft-sys`.

DK: It may be that you are not happy with the abstraction provided by a higher layer library.

DK: The issue that Fabian was having may have been due to naming.
We currently pinned a single Rust version.

MK: Vlad has hard-coded the assembly symbols?

DK: There may be some compiler intrinsics.

RD: How far are we from having a simple networking application (a simple web server) running?

DK: Once we test Musl, and we have `std` it should work, it shouldn't take long.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

There will a `unikraft-sys` for the low-level bindings.
And `unikraft` for the bindings.

TODO: See if it works on ARM (`app-helloworld-rust`).

TODO: Test support with Musl.

VB/SK: Merge the PR #680: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/680

RD: Make static library work on recent version of Unikraft.

MK: Wait for RD to provide the static library.
