## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

FP: I'm using `ukrustlib`.
With `helloworld` I'm stuck at the build steps.
It seems the build system doesn't pick up my lib.

VB: You have to register a `Makefile.uk` in the library directory.

VB: I'm stuck at a build error with `panic_abort`: can't find crate.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

FP: See the documentation on using the build system.

VB: Investigate issue with `panic_abort`.
