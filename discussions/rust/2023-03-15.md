## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

VB: I didn't get the chance to work on Rust.
I plan to do this in the next week.

MK: Work on thesis, then vacation.
Be back in mid-May.

FA: I looked into integrating this Rust argparse implementation from a while ago into current Rust's support in Unikfraft: https://github.com/TrueDoctor/unikraft/tree/hackathon/lib/rustarg
FA: I am not yet familiar with Unikraft's build system to know exactly how much effort is needed to expose to C code a function written in Rust.
Something worth keeping in mind is that we might want in the future to call Rust functions directly from other internal Rust libs I might want to translate in the future

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Ping Alex about the CI/CD system integration of `lib-rust` approved PRs.

RD: Open up the discussion on the linker step for build system.

VB: Get the `tiny-http` working with the native build system.

RD: Ask Fabian about the native `hello-world` build with Rust (Vlad's work).

FA: Continue working on the `ukargparse` porting to Rust.
