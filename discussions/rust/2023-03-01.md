## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

MK: The main blocker is with the Unikraft build system.

MK: If we want to support the build as it is now, we will need an external linking system.
I need:
- The name of the entry symbol
- A static library
- A linking script
- A post-build script

Then we could do it in rust.

That would make it possible to externalize the linking script of the application.

This is required for the unikraft-rs support.

Vlad's approach will work fine for Rust libraries.

There has been interest in running Rust applications with a Unikraft crate.

There is work required for the standard side.

I did some Unikraft-specific modification to make the standard library work.

MK: Everything is done using Musl.

MK: I opted out of a lot of Linux-specific things and used generic UNIX things.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RD: Get update from Vlad.

RD: Discuss about pulling out the linking step to an external build system.

MK: When the time is right, work on Rust standard library support.
