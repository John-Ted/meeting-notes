## :dart: Agenda

- Summary of goals
- Initial tasks

## :closed_book: Discussions

RD: We want to use the `governance` repository as the central place where we store organizing information (people, tasks, repositories).
In the ideal case all changes and updates would be triggered from the `governance` repository.

RD: We want to account for community members on the `governance` repository and use that to push information:

  - on GitHub teams: https://github.com/orgs/unikraft/teams
  - on Discord: http://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord
  - on the website: https://unikraft.org/community/people/

GM: First point is to introduce `DiscordClient`: https://github.com/unikraft/governance/issues/20

The entire range of TODOs has been summarized by AlexJ here: https://github.com/unikraft/governance/issues/12

We keep in contact on the `#infrastructure` channel on Discord.
