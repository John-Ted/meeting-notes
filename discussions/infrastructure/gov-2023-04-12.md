## :dart: Agenda

- Summary of goals
- Initial tasks

## :closed_book: Discussions

AJ: The code needs to be split along the way to the existing code in the `governance` repository.

AJ: You could enrich structures with required.
For example, you could add a color to the structure `Team`, a hex number.

AJ: We have channels:

- stable
- attached to a team
- able to create a new channel dynamically (ephemeral)

We could have a bot that gets a command to create a channel.

The Discord bot could be contacted directly by maintainers.

There are two use cases for the Discord bot:

- called by the governance repository
- directly called by the maintainers

AJ: I would create a new top-level directory called `discord/`.
And then I would create a `channel.yaml` file to detail the channels.

RM: In Discord, the category is a channel of type "team".

AJ: We would have the `Archived` category.
There is an `archived` attribute that archives the Discord server.
This is then locked for writing, but still available for reading.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RM: Split the PR (https://github.com/unikraft/governance/pull/22) along the existing code in the `governance` repository.

RM: Update the `Discord Governance` HackMD file: https://hackmd.io/@unikraft/ry5WlrNG2
