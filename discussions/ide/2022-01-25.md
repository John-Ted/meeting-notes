### Agenda

* IDE status update

### Discussions

Separating the parts that work on config files.

By Thursday, I want to push them.

We can use some GitHub actions.

AJ: Provide token for GitHub for the CI/CD action. Adina to provide the variable name.

AS: Extension to be renamed.

SJ: Review the submission after Thursday.

AS: Autocomplete in the kraft.yaml.

AJ: It should be possible. Inside the kraft repository, in the config/ folder, there are two JSON files: https://github.com/unikraft/kraft/blob/staging/kraft/config/specification_v0.5.json

AJ: There is probably an engine that reads this JSON file.

AJ: A Google link: https://dev.to/brpaz/how-to-create-your-own-auto-completion-for-json-and-yaml-files-on-vs-code-with-the-help-of-json-schema-k1i

AS: Create a short video with the IDE VSCode working.

### TODOs

AS: Push changes by Thursday.

SJ: Review changes puhsed by Adina.

AJ: Provide GitHub token.

AS: Create a short video to advertise the plugin.
