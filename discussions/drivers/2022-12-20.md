## :dart: Agenda

- Summary from Andreea
- Questions from Radu
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AD: Take drivers from FreeRTOS and add them to Unikraft.

AD: Have a generic hardware API, independent of the platform you use.

AD: And then, in a shim layer, each platform would have a given implementation.

AD: I worked on GPIO and created a simple app to toggle a LED.

AD: Next driver would be serial driver, UART.
It is easy to test.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RN: Build apps for ARM64 and run with `qemu-system-arm64`.

RN: Build app + setup in driver-shim repository: https://github.com/unikraft/driver-shim

RN: Upgrade to most recent Unikraft version.

RN: Run on Xilinx Ultrascale.
