### Agenda

Alignment of procfs support

### Discussions

RD: We want to have a Linux-compatible procfs interface.

RD: The `free` tool checks memory information.

SK: We need a mapping between what we have in ukstore.

SK: First step is figuring out what are the most important entries in procfs.
And then, yes, provide the information.

CC/SK: There are dynamic and static entries.

The ukstore path is provided by each library.

RD/SK: Let's start with a given entry, such as `/proc/meminfo` and build from that.

AJ: Should we have a performance perspective and cache information.

SK: If there is any caching, it should happen at library level.
ukstore should be only an interface to read statisitical data.

CC: Maybe we can discuss the filesystem approach.

SK: We have a devfs library.

CC: Does it have support for multiple layers?

SK: ramfs does it.

SK: procfs can follow a similar approach.

RD: Let's get ukstore upstreamed, then we complete the procfs work, then we can work on the minimal fs exposing the ukstore information.

### TODOs and Decisions

AM: Create a minimal procfs library with a layout.

AM: Create a `/proc/meminfo`.

AM: Name the library `posix-procfs`.
