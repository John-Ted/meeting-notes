- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PU: I finished the RX/TX config on VMware.

PU: For sending, I configured a static IP address.
It then sends ARP packates and I am able to capture those on the host.

PU: Reception is done using polling mode.

PU: I made some educated guesses.
In the DPDK netbuf, there is a field called `segs`.

PU: I've been looking into the `e1000` documentation and I think my assumption makes sense.

PU: By the next meeting, I think things will be more clear.

PU: There is an assert in the LWIP library, but I'm not sure why we are hitting it.

MR: Is it some of our code?

PU: Yes. It's an assert on the netbuf.

PU: Is licensing required?

RD: Get access to eXSi.

### VMware

PV: It loops indefinitely.
It may be because I took some code from DPDK and added to FreeBSD.

PV: The packet is being sent from the host but not being picked up.

PV: We need that function because the DPDK driver needs it, even though the FreeBSD doesn't provide.

### vsock

AT: I had an issue with initializing the receiving the vsockqueue.
