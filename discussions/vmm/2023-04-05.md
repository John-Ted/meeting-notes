## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: I'm enabling DPDK for Linux as a comparison to Unikraft of Hyper-V.

PV: Ideally I would be able to build DPDK from source code.

### VMware

PU: I found the PR causing the issue with VMware not working.
It has to do with the virtual memory API that Marc implemented.

PU: This is because I'm using MMIO.
I removed the entries from page tables because of a conflict.
But that breaks it on v0.8.

MR: The MMIO regions are not covered by the static page tables.
You could add them to static page tables.

MR: What is not upstream is the mapping in the lower range.
Is the mapping in the lower or the higher address range.

PU: It's an address that is mapped after 4GB.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PV: Get DPDK to run on Linux.

PU: Investigate requirements for `vmxnet` and for PCI Express.

PU: Blog post regarding VMware.

PU: Do a quick fix with static page mapping for MMIO.
