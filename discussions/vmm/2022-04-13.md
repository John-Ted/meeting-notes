### Agenda

Status updates on VMM tracks

### Discussions

PU: I did the PCI enumeration for VMware.
vmxnet3 wasn't seen, but now I solved it.

PU: You can configure the network interface.
By default it was `e1000` and changed it to `vmxnet3`.

PU: I can now write the driver for `vmxnet3`.

PU: I also looked into DPDK's implementation.
vmxnet3 + DPDK seems to do smart stuff (VLAN filtering).

FH: The first outcome to have ping working.

FH: For the VMware discussion we can do 3 slides and a screenshot.

PV: Work on porting vmbus channel communication.

PV: I need some memory alignment for a config channel?

SK: Allocating it earlier may be tricky.

PV: I was using `memalloc()` to get to that init function.

SK: You have `memalign()`, `posix_memalign()`, `palloc`.
See `include/ukalloc/ukalloc.h`.

AT: I worked on the `virtio-mmio` part.
The network device is being register in `lib/uknet/` as `netdev0`.

AT: I'm using Unikraft v0.7.
There is an issue with building against `lib-lwip`.

### TODOs and Decisions

PU: Work on vmxnet3 DPDK driver.

PU: Reply to the VMware contact person with architecture + screenshots for VMware WAMR work.

PV: Continue work on vmbus communication channel.

PV: Look into `include/ukalloc/ukalloc.h` for functions.

AT: Rebase Firecracker work on Unikraft 0.8.

AT: Rebase virtio-mmio PR on Unikraft + Firecracker.
