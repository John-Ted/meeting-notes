### Agenda

Status updates on VMM tracks

### Discussions

PU: I sent the branch on the VMware channel: https://github.com/ungps/unikraft/tree/vmxnet3

PU: I feel more comfortable.
I took some time to work on that.

RD: Platform support article.

PV: Link to Hyper-V platform: https://github.com/paulvlase/plat-hyperv/commits/main

PV: I have something that builds but I need to make it run.

PV: When listing devices, it lists devices.

PV: The issue that I fixed: they used DMA to allocate memory.

AT: We have networking on Firecraker.
The main issue was the use of the modern part of the virtio implementation.
One issue was the header size and the other is on state.

AT: TX wasn't working because we were using a function for the virtio-pci instead of virtio.
We were sending bytes to registers instead of sending in memory.

AT: There are still some issue:
* There is an unhandled error message from the interrupt.
  But it's working.
  There are error messages.
* When parsing the mmio device structure, it sends the size of 4KB.
  We need to find a way to parse those 4KB.

AT: There are some optimization features.

SK: I'm also considering to put firecraker as a whole in the core repository.

SK: There is a follow item on the open block.
