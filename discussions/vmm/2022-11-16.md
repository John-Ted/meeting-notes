## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

PV: Hammering the networking driver.
I need to allocate a page and use it for GPADL.

PV: I need to merge code from DPDK with the one from FreeBSD.
DPDK use the Linux code in 

MR: What does this support code encompass?

PV: It's the `vmbus` implementation.

MR: Is this page only required for offloading features.

PV: I just saw this functionalitity and I went to set it

PU: `vmxnet3`: I found why I couldn't start the device.
The device is connected with PCI Express, not PCI.
And PCI Express is not supported in Unikraft.

PU: I'm trying to write another driver that could use the `e1000` driver, that uses PCI.
The DPDK implementation is complex, as it was made to work on multiple NICs.

MR: I'm wondering if this is the right way to go.
The Ethernet driver is probably useful for other scenarios.

MR: Maybe we have code for PCI Express.

PU: I know that `e1000` with PCI.
I tried it with PCI support only in the VM.

AT: I've created the draft PR for the boot part.

AT: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/648, 
https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/610

AT: We wanted to look into the boot device to get the boot time.
You need to update the boot device.

MR: I used that for the demo we are doing on Friday and it works great.

AT: I don't have anything on pending.

MR: There are still things that can be improved.

MR: See into how Firecracker works with virtio-vsock devices.
This is something to look into.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

RP: Try the PR on Hyper-V: https://github.com/unikraft/plat-hyperv/pull/1

PV: Update the PR with the steps for running applications.

PV: Hammer the implementation of the networking driver for Hyper-V.

PU: Implement the `e1000` driver for VMware.

MR: I will ask about code for PCI Express.

MR: Provide feedback on Firecracker PRs:
https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/610,
https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/648

AT: Look into virtio-vsock.
