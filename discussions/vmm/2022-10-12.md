## :closed_book: Discussions

AT: We needed to the have that in conjunction in the networking.

MR: The change in the boot parameter is already upstream.

RD: We want to have draft PRs submitted for the plat rearch discussion.

AT: I was able to boot nginx with ramfs.


PV: Looking to make networking work with Hyper-V.
I took parts from DPDK.
I'm using a driver from FreeBSD.
This driver has a different way in storing those channels.
This is using a vmbus interface that you use to query.

PV: The goal is to get those channel and map those channels to queues and send those to Hyper-V.

PV: Need to do some hammering.


PU: I was working on vmxnet3.
I took the DPDK driver and adapted it to our internal data.

PU: I was dropping extra fields from the DPDK driver.

PU: I wasn't able to get it to build.
