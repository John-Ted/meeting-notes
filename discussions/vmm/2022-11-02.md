## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AT: I integrated the booting for 0.10.

AT: I worked on the PR for the boot part.

MR: I already took a look in the PR.

MR: There is a boot time feature.

PV: I had issues building with Hyper-V.
I was using the wrong path to the library.
I had to use `lwip` instead of `lib-lwip`.
It builds, but it crashes.

PV: It fails on `uk_pull` which I did not initialize.
I'm doing it one step at a time.
I'm working to get something sent.

PV: There isn't support for block devices DPDK, but the student can look into the FreeBSD driver.

MR: The problem with Firecracker is you can only have a single serial device.
And you require two of them, one used for debugging.

PU: I spend time debugging the reason for not getting the correct values for the PCI configuration.
I found one thing that might help me.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AT: Submit boot PR.

MR: Discuss about boot time measurements next time as an item of work for Andrei.

RD: Have RÄƒzvan Pricop join our calls.

PV: Update the PR with the steps for running applications.

MR: Provide link to GDB stub.

PU: Provide updates on the interogation of the PCI configuration.
