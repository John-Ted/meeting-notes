### Agenda

* Initial steps for Firecraker support

### Discussions

VB: We had Firecracker support.
It wasn't a separat platform library.
It's likely on a private GitLab branch at NEC.

VB: On that branch there was no device support.

RD: There is virtio-mmio support done by Paul Ungureanu, but someone should pick up the draft PRs and complete them:
* https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/250
* https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/249

VB: If there is virtio-mmio support, we could support devices.

CR: A blog from OSv is useful for the implementation of Firecracker: http://blog.osv.io/blog/2019/04/19/making-OSv-run-on-firecraker/

VB: It was used in the paper in the raw format.

VB: Firecracker doesn't implement the legacy virtio interface implemented by QEMU.

CB: In order to run Firecracker, even without network devices, was there a requirement for a specific booting support?
There was a patch in the file that defined the binary sections.

VB: From what I know the only difference is jumping into the entry point for 64 bits.

RD/VB: We want an implementation of Firecracker support as an external platform library, similar to Solo5: https://github.com/unikraft/plat-solo5

### TODOs and Decisions

VB: Locate code for initial Firecraker implementation.

AT: Look into OSv blog article.
Look into initial Firecracker implementation.

RD: Assign someone to look into virtio PRs.

RD: Schedule next call on virtio + Firecracker support.
