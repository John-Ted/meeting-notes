## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### VMware

PaulU: I made the http-reply app work.

PaulU: It always fails on the 6th HTTP request.

PaulU: Ping works.

PaulU: It gives an assertion error.

PaulU: A ping takes 30ms.

PaulU: I tested on VMware Workstation.

### vsock

AndreiT: I recently solved the problem with the Unikraft guest connecting to the Linux host.
There were multiple issue: alignment of headers, the hardcoding of the CID (vsock address).

AndreiT: Now I'm trying to make the vsock server in Unikraft work.
There is a problem when the server listens.
I'm using Wireshark to capture packets to debug.
The server blocks in `accept()` and the client returns an error on `connect()`.


## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PaulU: Investigate the issue with the HTTP request failure.

PaulU: Remove debugging messages to check for latency correction.

AndreiT: Investigate issue with vosck server in Unikraft.

AndreiT: Create draft PR with vsock after the issue above is solved.
