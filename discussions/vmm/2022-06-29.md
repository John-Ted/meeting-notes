### Agenda

Status updates on VMM tracks

### Discussions

AT: On PCI there are some flags that would make qemu work with modern mode virtio interface.

AT: mmio doesn't work with the modern interface on QEMU.
It only works on Firecracker (it's actually the only way).

AT: I did measurements on booting.

AT: I don't know anything about the Firecracker snapshotting.

PV: I am attaching the network device done by `lwip_init`, which calls `uknetdev_addif`.
Nothing blocking right now

### TODOs and Decisions

AT: Provide virtio update PR.

AT: Message on the #vmm-general channel about getting boot time.
Also ask on the Firecracker Slack.

AT: Measure QEMU with modern mode.

RD: Ask Marc and Simon about creating a draft Firecracker PR.
