## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

AT: I rebased the changes for the new version of Unikraft.

MR: If you have any questions regarding the parameters, ping me.

PU: I don't have updates.
I am setting a goal to have a draft PR done by next week.

RD: Draft PRs to be created for VMware and Hyper-V.

PV: I need to get a list of channels.
But I don't need to do that if I only use one queue.

PV: I need to do some management to attach to this device.

MR: Could you already send commands to the device.

RD: When do you think someone could take part in the development of the Hyper-V platform?

PV: Currently I can get this channel.
There is a chanel per device.
Then, anyone can work on that.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AT: Create draft PR with networking work.

AT: Use boot arguments for Firecraker initialization.

PU: Create draft PR in the core Unikraft repository (for now) with VMware support.

PV: Create draft PR in the future `plat-hyperv` repository.

PV: Investigate further the network driver.

RD: Create repositories for `plat-vmware` and `plat-hyperv`.
