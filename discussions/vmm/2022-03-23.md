### Agenda

Status updates on VMM tracks

### Discussions

AT: The problem for Firecracker 0.7 was a wrong entry point.
So we have a hello-world image running on Firecraker 0.7.

AT: Firecracker user MMIO for transport and virtio-net and virtio-block.

PU: I tested virtio-mmio on x86.
It's in draft format: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/250

SK: Without the base addresses you don't know how to map / use the MMIO devices.

SK: From the screenshot I've seen, Firecraker generates a command line to pass these addresses as parameters.

FH: Firecracker OSv implementation is a good starting point: http://blog.osv.io/

PU: Firecracker passes the MMIO addresses in the command line, similar to QEMU: https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/7d409e5a989f82b09a73533decc2da74238a7d0e/src/vmm/src/device_manager/mmio.rs#L240

PU: Useful Linux: https://www.talhoffman.com/2021/07/18/firecracker-internals/

SK: Is the format of the command specific to the image or is it something configurable.

MR: The boot process is built closely for Linux.
Firecraker builds Linux specific structures and passes the pointer to the structure in a register.

SK: We should parse the boot information.

FH: The long term goal is using a fast VMM such as Firecraker.

PU: With regard to devices, I saw how devices are enumerated in KVM.
I couldn't do that on VMware.
It's difficult, because there is no documentation on this from VMware.

SK: Look into other unikernels or FreeBSD running on top of VMware.

PU: On the WAMR: I got familiar to the concept: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-wamr

PV: I'm working on the drivers.
I worked on the timer.
I changed the timers (monotonic).
It builds, it boots, but not serial output.

PV: I can see messages on the VM console, but not on the serial port.

SK: Could it be that the image is broken?
Sometimes the multiboot messes with the boot process.

PV: Maybe there is an issue with my setup.

PV: My initial step was to remote the TSC clock.
I implemented a time_block() function.
Maybe that causes an issues.

PV: The virtual timer is implemented as a vmbus device in FreeBSD.

### TODOs and Decisions

AT: Look at how the MMIO arguments are used / generated for Firecraker (command line).

AT: Look at what is the startup process for Firecraker and whether there is a new process / guest created.

AT: Use Paul's PR for Firecraker networking support.

CV: Figure out how suspend / resume happens in Firecracker.

PU: Boot Linux and do an `lspci` to see the devices.

PU: Try to build the WAMR previous work: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-wamr

RD: Install ESX at UPB.

PV: Continue working on getting passed the timer issue.
