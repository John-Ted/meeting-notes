## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PaulV: Last time I checked DPDK and I tried the `vpfio` function.
The existing is also for PCI.

PaulV: There is another device from Melanox that's using PCI.

PaulV: I wasn't able to get DPDK running with Hyper-V.

PaulV: I reverted to the initial idea of running FreeBSD.

PaulV: I run the the `net-vsc` FreeBSD driver.
The FreeBSD kernel is using a statically-linked driver.

PaulV: I tried to build a new kernel and boot in the new kernel.
It hangs at boot time.

PaulV: I want to add extra messages in the driver to compare with what what we have in Unikraft.

### VMware

PU: I did measurements with TCP on `vmxnet3`, `e1000`, `e1000e`.
