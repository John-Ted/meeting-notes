## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: The channel communication still doesn't work.
By placing printf, it doesn't seem the interrupt is for my channel (ID 14).

PV: The interrupt is triggered, but the interrupt response is not OK.

PV: I'm trying to map other structures.
I aimt to complete the initialization of the channel.

PV: It's either I'm not doing a correct initialization.
Or I'm sending a bad message.

RD: You could see whether there are any ways to do 

PV: One other solution is to try using a BSD instance to see if there is anything going.

PV: The driver (adapted from BSD) uses multiple threads.

### VMware

PU: I'm were I was before.
I need to work on the configuration for TX / RX.

PU: I want to first get the RX going.

PU: I then want to modify / update the code.
But it's of low priority.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

PV: See if there are logging information provided by Hyper-V.

PV: Run BSD kernel with Hyper-V, see what happens behind the scenes.

PU: Work on getting RX going on VMware.

RD: Get update from Răzvan Pricop and Andrei Topală.

RD: Announce hackathon on Saturday, January 14, 2023, full day.
