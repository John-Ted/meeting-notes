ȘtefanJ
* I worked on PRs app-helloworld-go README (https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld-go/pull/7) and app-python3 README (https://github.com/unikraft/app-python3/pull/6)
* I reviewed PRs app-helloworld xen docs (https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld/commit/2d40acba5d1d7eaea5e9357733e170630fa511d1) and kraft index-out-of-range (https://github.com/unikraft/kraft/pull/82)
* I worked on kraft documentation here (https://github.com/unikraft/docs/blob/main/content/en/docs/usage/init.md)

RăzvanV
* I've been working on implementing a system to avoid defining syscalls that are not supported on ARM64, starting from the suggestions I received here: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/336. Unfortunately, I've found out that things aren't straight forward. Other functions are dependent on some of the syscall definitions that need to be removed, therefore generating a chain of build errors. I will look deeper into this situation and come with an update ASAP.

Gabi
* I added support for running app-helloworld on a Xen environment without using kraft: https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld/pull/5
* I reviewed some PRs for updating the documentation on app-python3 (https://github.com/unikraft/app-python3/pull/6) and app-helloworld-go (https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld-go/pull/7)
* I started working on this PR based on Stefan's comment: https://github.com/unikraft/kraft/pull/82

Sergiu
* I reviewed and approved this lwip related PR: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip/pull/15
* I also started looking into the posix-sockets PR and began by first rebasing it and integrating the unresolved feedback from its comments: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/65

FlorinP
* I created a kraft.yaml file for configuring, building and running app-smart-contract-config on kvm with kraft: https://github.com/cs-pub-ro/app-smart-contract-config/tree/libsodium
* I started working on completing the README for the app-smart-contract-config app with instructions for kraft usage.
