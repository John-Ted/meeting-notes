## Summary of Activities

RD
* I worked with Razvan Virtan on the ARM64 syscall PR: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/336
* I planned meetings for next week.
* I helped people with their work ( @Sebastian Samoilescu , @Alex Apostolescu )
* I started looking into the DLang issue mentioned by Alex Apostolescu on `dlang`

CC
* Reviewed https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/369
* Reviewed https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/413
* Did a pass  over the other PRs
* Gave my 2 cents on the dlang issue

DU
* Skimmed through the discussions on the rust channel
* Run a hello world project in Rust
* Tried to use an external rust crate

AA
* I continued working on updating lib-druntime in the first part, found some weird errors (most likely due to lack of updates on lib for the last year) and passed it to Razvan Deaconescu for further debugging.
* For the second part, I looked over the current state of lib-v8.

RV
* I worked with Razvan Deaconescu on solving the arm64 syscall issue. We've redesigned the initial solution [1], so that now the syscall architecture check is done automatically by the build system, bypassing any compilation guards added by the programmer when he wants to implement a new syscall. These 2 PRs should be enough to solve the problem [2] [3].

[2]: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/422

SS
* made design changes on new ukcpuid caching library
* looked for places where cpuid instruction is used at this moment
* looked into a better way to store information inside library
* I plan to make a PR with the changes before 22.03.2022

SJ
* I reviewed prs [1] and [2]
* I looked on this pr[3], will finish reviewing it on Monday-Tuesday 

[1]: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/418

[2]: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/407

[3]: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/404

RN
* trying to reduce the vm creation time from 60ms using a tcp server
* integrated an own tcp server to work with kfx
* benchmark the tcp server against xenstore (currently no improvment, but will continue exploring)

AT
* worked on booting unikraft 0.7 on firecracker
* found the place where firecracker gets KVM_EXIT_SHOWDOWN signal and tried to solve the issue

PV:
* Ran Unikraft on KVM with UEFI to check if we get the same error as on Hyper-V. Multiboot v1 worked, the Hello World message was displayed on the serial. But in case of multiboot v2, it crashed on the same line as on Hyper-V, but in case of KVM the ebx register is 0x1000, instead of 0x0.
* Looked over the KVM platform code on how to use the Hyper-V reference time counter instead of PIT.
