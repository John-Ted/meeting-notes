## Summary of Activities

RăzvanD / Teo
* We worked on Nyx and kAFL.
* We found that Nyx is a quite complicated piece of software and kAFL has all the bits we need for our generic OS / unikernel fuzzing project.

Cezar
* Did a pass over all PRs where I am active and checked the status/contributed where needed.
* Started reviewing 2 arm-related patches, which I will try testing soon

PaulV
* Debugged why it doesn't switch to long mode.
* Tried to read more sectors from floppy disk because I Found out that I also need to read more sectors from floppy disk to load the page table into memory.

ȘtefanJ
* I worked on setting up the vscode extension and documented the issues I ran into here: https://github.com/unikraft/ide-vscode/issues/2

RăzvanV
* I've droped the sigaltstack PR (https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/301) form the main Unikraft repo and updated kraft.yaml for app-helloworld-go, so that it automatically enables libc-like stubs for the syscalls (https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld-go/pull/6)
* I've updated my SMP PR, enabling spinlocks usage (https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/373)

Gabi
* I managed to run nginx with RamFS support on Xen environment.
  Also, I finally ran the sqlite and redis applications on Xen.
* For the nginx and redis I still have that problem with networking.
  I can't make requests to servers, my intuition is that something is not set up well for that bridge.
