## Summary of Activities

CC: Rebased and brought the memory ballooning patches up to date

CC: Discovered fixdep.c inside unikraft and tried various modes to run it, but no success so far.
 I'll continue trying to find different versions to run fixdep.
 I think the running suggestions are wrong from the comments or Unikraft has a different format for `*.d` files.

GM: Made Nginx running on Xen.

GM: I will try to run Uniprof with it, but to make the tests better I need to make some requests and right now I have some issues with the configuration of the bridge.
I think I need to add extra parameters to the configuration file.

RD: I helped Gabi troubleshoot the filesystem mounting issue with nginx.

RD: I installed two phyisical servers at UPB (one for Xen, the other for KVM) that we will use for Unikraft development.
A Windows installation (for Hyper-V support) is under way.

SM: I looked into testing the vscode extension.
I had some things I had to troubleshoot but in the end I managed to get it working on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and it looks fine to me.
