## Summary of Activities

RD: I included michpappas's reviews in PR https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/318, and created a new PR: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/374

RD: I started working on PR https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/316

SM: I started looking into adding timestamps to loupe.

SM: I updated the documentation PR's[1] after Gabi's reviews.

[1] https://github.com/unikraft/app-nginx/pull/3,
https://github.com/unikraft/app-sqlite/pull/3,
https://github.com/unikraft/app-redis/pull/3

CC: Used fixdep inside the linux kernel and saw how it works.
Made a sketch-up of the steps needed to include fixdep & co inside Unikraft.
I'll create a document explaining all steps soon.

GM: Reviewed PRs for update documentation for some applications( app-nginx, app-sqlite, app-redis).

GM: I also tried to run Nginx  on Xen with a script as a parameter on the virtual interface(vif), but still not working.
I will try to figure out if it's a problem with the request or with the response because right now I'm getting a timed out error.
